    <h1>Pizza</h1>
    <p>Pizza is a popular dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, olives, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>

        <li>Prepare the pizza dough by mixing flour, water, yeast, and salt. Knead until smooth.</li>
